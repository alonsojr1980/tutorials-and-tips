Hey guys,

Since bypassing the Download Quota has been fixed for a few days, I think I found a new solution.

I'm not sure what the restrictions on it are but that's how you do it:

- It requires a Gdrive Account

The old bypass worked by copying the file where the quota has been exceeded.
All you need to do now is instead of copying the file to create a shortcut into a folder.

After that just download the whole folder (it might require more than one file inside, I am not sure.)



GDrive will say it is preparing the download / compressing the files so it might take quite a while. But sooner or later your download will start.



I had 2 rar files which I could not download, but using this method I was able to download them both.



I am not sure if there are possible restrictions on this method, AFAIK files will get the quota exceeded message after they've been downloaded for more than 2TB during a day. But maybe google also has a system to predict piracy and will flag the files even when they didnt exceed the limit and then this method will work, but if it actually exceeded 2TB it will not work. I don't know yet.



Also since it says its compressing / preparing files it might be that it might not work with bigger archives. I only tested it with 2 5gb files and it worked.
